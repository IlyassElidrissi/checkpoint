Name	Reason I‚Äôm still not fully confident
Segment Tree	The range query + update logic is subtle. I sometimes mix up lazy propagation or whether updates should be point or range.
Fenwick Tree / BIT (Binary Indexed Tree)	The bit-manipulation logic (especially using i & -i) is elegant but not intuitive yet.
Suffix Array / Suffix Tree	String algorithms with suffix structures, LCP arrays etc. have many edge cases and heavy preprocessing.
Network Flow / Max Flow / Min Cut	The concept of augmenting paths, residual networks, capacities, and how augmenting changes the residual graph is challenging.
Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) with path compression & union by rank	I understand the concept, but I sometimes lose track of how path compression reorganizes parent links and the amortized complexity argument.
Quick Sort (especially randomized or 3-way partitioning variants)	I understand the basic quick sort, but the optimizations (random pivot selection, partitioning for many equal keys) are harder.
Radix Sort / Counting Sort	The idea is clear, but correctly implementing in code (especially stability, base choice, multiple passes) can be tricky in certain inputs (negative numbers, large range).


üõ†Ô∏è How I plan to master them

Trace by hand ‚Äî step through small input cases and draw how the data structure changes.

Write code from scratch (without looking up reference) to force me to handle edge cases.

Compare with visual animations (e.g. VisuAlgo) to see where my logic diverges.

Solve problems using those structures/algorithms (e.g. in competitive programming or coding challenge sites).

Explain the algorithm to someone else (or even to myself) ‚Äî teaching often reveals gaps in understanding.
